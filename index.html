	   I really love to playing in the park, so I wanted to draw attention to problems with pollution. I made a game where you sort falling items into recycling, trash, or compost bins. This helps people learn how to help the environment by reducing waste. I hope that more people can practice sorting their trash properly and we can have cleaner parks!
